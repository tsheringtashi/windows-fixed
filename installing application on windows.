After much finding online for the solution, I could resolve with the following steps:

    install conda from (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
    open up conda prompt
    create a folder (mkdir rasafolder)
    cd rasafolder
    From here you can type the script as below:
    conda update conda
    python3 -m venv virtual_name
    .\virtual_name\Scripts\activate
    conda install ujson
    pip install rasa
